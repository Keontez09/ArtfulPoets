Body saying I am too tired to go on, and I'm not really a fan of dying.

Spirit saying just a little bit longer we must endure.

The heart chooses not to speak, just a single beat in agreement with the spirit.

Mind replies why do you even try? You see they don't care about rules here.

&nbsp;

Body replied in turn, he's right! I don't want to fight anymore.

Spirit replied, silence! For you know nothing, and the darkness has blinded our eyes.

Heart again beats, but this time twice.

Mind pleads, don't you remember all the good you did and received nothing?

Body stands in awe, and nods with shame.

Spirit said, hush now and listen.

Heart steadily racing...

Spirit is speaking...

To the body, don't you remember the gratification you obtained when I carried you through the rain, did you feel a drop?

Body...

To the mind, I have given you piece and revealed to you those things that are evil. On the flip side I have showed you many wonders, yet you lack full faith, and show this by doubt.

Mind says but...

Spirit interrupts, but nothing if you want to get right then get right. However, you must be able to endure the darkness of night. I never promised it would be easy, but necessary. You shouldn't worry about what others are saying, your only mission is to focus on what's right...

SPIRIT YELLS, WHO CAN YIELD SUCH A HEART IN WHICH YOU SEEK BUT ME?

And the heart beats three times in silence and awe...
