I don't know what that other dude talking bout, but to me it just appears nothing is the same. My question to you would be, why did you choose to put me in this cage? Force me to see all these things and never have the words to bring change? Was it a test in which you knew I'd never study. Or did you plant me here knowing I had fear (of you), just for me to simply gaze at FAME (<span style="color: #252525; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Nimbus Sans L', Arial, 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif; line-height: 26.3999996185303px;">Forecasting Analysis and Modeling Environment), and return my findings... If I'm right and my eyes don't deceive me, all I can truly tell you is a lot of hollowed men carry tears, through these times of madness, but they all find some reason to keep trucking. To me that's saying alot, so won't you please be so kind to take off the pad lock; of my cage? I'm asking to be free again!</span>
