Dear Lord,

"If your healing in this season, please don't do it without me." I heard this song in the Barbar shop and I couldn't get my Shazam to work properly. I can tell you though, I felt a shaking inside of me. Khalil Gabran described it as pain, I learned to relate my pain with my tears. Funny I know cause I know your much higher than any pain I can imagine. So I say again, "Lord! Whatever your doing in this season, please! Don't do it without me!" You see I've always known you've been there, but I can no longer sit by and just watch. Shield me! Take me up from my imprisonment, I feel selfish for even asking, but I know that you have the power to heal. The enemy has used me in ways I don't care to explain, but somehow I know purpose and I carried that with me in the company of my enemies. "Lord! If your blessing this season, please! Don't do it without me!" I've understood for sometime now, but didn't know how to reach you. I lnow my logic can only take me so far, and I've reached a point where I can no longer go on... Plus I don't want to be carried. My mother has this keychain that states, "my precious child, when you can only see one set of footprints in the sands, it was then that I carried you." I have no desire to run, which I learned through patience. I have no time for shame, which I learned by way of grace. I know you have a huge itinerary, but PLEASE don't do it without me!
