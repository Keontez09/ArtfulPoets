Haha, boy you stupid. lol. 5hats just the subconscious of my mind wondering what you would say about my logic in even writing this... lol mam it feel good to thank about you dude, for real. I know we didn't get a chance to kick it when I last came home, but dude you were always number one.

Remember, that I said, I don't think P was meant to lead us, he was just meant to show us the way. He use to hit us with that Mr. MIYAGEOU everytime. I remember the time he knocked you in the bushes of that one apartment. Dude you went flying, and then to my sudden surprise you, to peakiING out the window you and him were outside talking about girls. Now I get what he was to you. Bruh for the longest time, I couldn't see past my own perception, and not many will admit it don't you ever forget it.

Look do me a favor and take care of our Ma. Man she adores you, takes time to ask me have I talked to you. Dude thsee are the times we all wished for, know what God is showing you and be cations of signs. They are there for a reason.

Didn't come here to preach, but I just wanted you to know, no matter how many cars you see me roll uo, remember I'm just trying to be like you. You save the world everyday weather you know it or not. Weather the storm, and keep smiling, truth be told I was always jealous of your teeth. Now look at me, this tabbaco got me lagging and back track on the past where we were never meant to Live. In short, Â remember that PC without beers is not the beach, and what's a good time without a story to tell.
