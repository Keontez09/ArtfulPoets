Dear Babe,

I know deep down you knew this day would come. Cause we both know we couldn't deny destiny. Both our hearts beating through that gaze in your eyes. Teach me how to love.

Cause deep down I know you can see through my lies. I can't explain the connection, but you've always been the only one to truly break down my walls. I learned early that all a man has in this world is his word. So here is my word, Teach me how to love you.
