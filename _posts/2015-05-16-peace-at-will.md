Dear Sir, give me peace today. A peace that sets me free from my oppressors. Help me to walk with a clear mind, and not worry about the people that don't like me. I still want to be able to care for the ones that prosecute me. I pray that you take the "getting back" out of my hands.

Please Sir, I beg of thee, if upon today my mind starts to wonder upon things that are beyond me. I pray you bring me back to reality. Grant me the strength to walk in your peace. I'll forever kneel at your feet, and pray, I just beg you walk beside me!

I used to be so witty, till I learned or I was forced to hit em with the best response which is silence.
