Dear Lord, thank you one more time for dying for me.

Thank you for waking me up again, now show me what to do.

I am weak, but courageous.

I am naive, but intelligent.

I am short, but so tall.

I ask that you strengthen my stance, and tend to my heart.

I ask that you let me walk with you, and not be carried; you've done enough by letting me write to you.

I don't know how it will get through the grapevine, but let me belong to myself again.

AMEN...<a href="http://www.artfulpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-02-21_10-18-47.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-83" src="http://www.artfulpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-02-21_10-18-47-300x225.jpg" alt="2015-02-21_10-18-47" width="300" height="225" /></a>
