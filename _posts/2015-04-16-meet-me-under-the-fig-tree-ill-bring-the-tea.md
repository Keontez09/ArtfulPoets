Many a nights I've completed the unthinkable. Taking a grown woman outside herself. Making sure to take my time and do it right. Seeing as how I grew up listening to Jodeci and the Artist formerly known as Prince. It can get a little scandalous, but I promise to be gentle. I'll only nibble and won't bite.

Make love to the right side of your brain and remind you who we are. We are decedents of the first man and woman. So meet me at the tree and stop playing. And I'll show you why if they knew like I knew they'd call me the last dying light.

I promise to give you hop, but won't keep you. For the better part of my life I've learned it's wrong to imprison what was born free. You do know we're born free, right? Pardon my aggressivenes, but right now I'm raging against the machine, and hate all things insecure.

Truth be told, it creeps the hell out of me. I've routed enough bars, and turned up enough nights to know all about shining. However, it's not my time for that, I have a greater mission. Right now it's to make love to your mind. To be continued until next time, I'm smoking my black. Another day, another time.
