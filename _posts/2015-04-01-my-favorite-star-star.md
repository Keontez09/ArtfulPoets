It took some time, and a lot of sleepless nights fir me to see this is really true love. Now I don't know if you'll even shine for me anymore.Â  If I'm lost I doubt you'll even guide me back home.

But just like good ol Ray-mon, that won't stop me from looking up at you and wishing. I've learned that through life's troubles it's hope that gets us through.

So between me and you I miss the little shit that we would do. Like sitting in my front yar, staring up at the stars; talking about our plans after high school. Or our first movie date, that went terribly great. I got to admit I was nervous as fuck, but that didn't stop me from thinking about kissing you.

Perhaps the best memory of all, was when you hit me with the Rick Ross "Huh", while telling me why you had a gun. I remember thinking, she is a thug. Crazy I know, but laying behind you on the couch have me something to look forward too. As we watched B.A.P.S., seeing you cry though was the hard part of it all. I should have stayed is all I'm trying to say.
