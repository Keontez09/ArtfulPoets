Before we all fell from the sky, oh lord please tell me why... Why you decided to catch us before we ever hit the ground, and why where so afraid of gravity! You are my holder the lender of my soul for just one more pluck at that tree. Sir you've set me free and I often times wonder why, you did so with nothing more required of me but to live within one another. Don't be shocked it's just the Holy Ghost speaking on the behalf Of you and me. When will we ever learn that your beauty shines upon us all? When will destruction ever cease to follow us and disguise itself as the false amazing grace? When will we stop being afraid of one another, when will the fog forget to leave us with doubt? When will we learn to live our lives without doubt of one another? Now comes the night! Farther when will we learn that we are not forgotten?
