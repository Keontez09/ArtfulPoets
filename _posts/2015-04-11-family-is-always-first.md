Not really sure how to start this off, so I'll just start writing. I've missed yall man! We got to have another bbq, or we can all just book our rooms to the beach. Last year I was so disappointed, I'm not even gone lie. I'm means what's a hurricane without wind? I'll tell you, a pretty good damn time in the sand.

To be G about it, I really think we should bbq on the beach. However, that may be a little too country for some folks. I'm just thinking about when we were kids, and west point beach was the best thang popping. I know there are people missing, but I'd swear to you if build it they will come. Don't try and figure out the reference.

A couple things off my chest as usual, Tanisha I'm proud of you. You were stubborn there for awhile, but he finally got through to you. Lol. Tae, dude! Whatever happened to you calling me back? You too have always been the break dancers, guarantee anybody that knows yall will remember that about you. At least in our family. Stay strong, keep going.

MeMe, well I think J. Cole said it best, deep down every poet just want to feel loved. So since Cuz locked down I'll be the voice I'm sure he wanted yall to hear. Don't ever be shamed of who you are... there is nothing else, besides hold your head up high. Stay grounded Cuz, and ya got to let go off that anger. Believe me when I tell you I've been out here in these streets. Learned a thing or two, and I can't recall a time where my anger got me out of anything. To describe it I like to picture a dragon. A dragon so mighty his wings blot out the sun. However this dragon's strength also heavily relys on his weakness. But it's no more a grander dragon than the one plaguing everybody else's mind. So the point is let it go. Unleash it from its bondage of Broken Hearts of hearts. You'll find that it comes back flying whenever you truly need it. Not to destroy you, but to deploy you to greater heights, a.k.a. higher state of consciousness... it's getting to real for me too finish right now, but I'll Holla at yall later tonight.
