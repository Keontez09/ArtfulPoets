<p class="Standard paragraph" style="margin: 0px; position: relative; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; color: #000000; line-height: normal; widows: auto; padding: 0px !important; background-color: transparent !important;"><span class="Standard paragraph" style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 12pt; margin: 0px !important;">No that we're here, lets not pretend. Better yet, let's just forget. Forget about the night I went running to my Brother's grave and dared you to stop me! You see I ain't as bad as you thought, cause even down in this cellar where you kept me I still kept praying for you.</span></p>

But I don't hate you anymore, although I admit at one point I did. Until my Mother told me I should know better. I was seventeen! And YOU only you would be plotting to betray me with your false love. But I guess that's just how shit go.</span></p>

Wonder what you'd tell me when it comes to certain situations. I hope that when you flying among the clouds you stop and look at me, and wonder what good friends we could've been. With your awesome brain in my type of style man, we could've conquered the world. But now I know all you were out for was my soul, I'd call you a clown if I wasn't so angry.</span></p>

It's so easy to point the finger and say what we should've done different, but how about a little effort instead of rotten fruit!</span></p>

So all that's left to say is, “go to sleep, just go to sleep.” “I'll see you G!” Still doesn't excuse the fact that it hurts, and you've done so much lying you can't even speak. So just sleep. I'll see you when I see you. ~Little Devil</span></p>
